## 🔧 Building from Source

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sorokya/eoweb.git
cd eoweb
```

### 2. Prepare game data files

You’ll need to copy the game’s `data`, `gfx`, `sfx`, `mfx`, `jbox`, and `maps` directories into the `public` folder.

The resulting structure should look like this:

```
public/
├── data/dat001.edf
├── gfx/gfx001.egf
├── sfx/sfx001.wav
├── jbox/jbox001.mid
├── mfx/mfx001.mid
└── maps/00005.emf
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed, then run:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### 4. Run the development server

To start the Vite development server with hot reload:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### 5. Build for production

To compile a static build ready for deployment:

```sh
pnpm build
```

The production-ready output will be in the `dist/` directory, which you can host using any static HTTP server.
